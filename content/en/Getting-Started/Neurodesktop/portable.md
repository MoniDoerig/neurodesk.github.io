## Installing TinyRange

- Unzip the archive to some local path on your computer. It's recommended not to extract it to a network drive.
- Open a terminal in the extracted archive and run `./tinyrange login` or `tinyrange login` on Windows.
- Once you see the `tinyrange:~#` type `exit`.

## Enabling Hardware Acceleration

- **Windows:** This might require admin privileges in some cases. Search in your start menu for "Turn Windows features on or off.". Find "Hyper-V Hypervisor" or "Windows Hypervisor Platform" and make sure it's enabled. Alternatively, run `dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:"HypervisorPlatform"` in an Administrator shell. Then restart your computer. To test if it's working correctly run: `tinyrange.exe env check-hv`
- **Ubuntu/Other Linux:** It should already work out of the box. If not make sure your user account has permission to read/write `/dev/kvm`.
- **MacOS:** No extra steps required. It already works.
