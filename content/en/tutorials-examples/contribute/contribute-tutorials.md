  A brief guide for contributing new tutorials.
---

We welcome tutorials that walk users through using tools or workflows available in Neurodesk. These tutorials are valuable learning resources that support accessible, reproducible neuroimaging.

Tutorials are written in Markdown and hosted in the [`neurodesk.github.io:tutorials`](https://github.com/Neurodesk/neurodesk.github.io/tree/main/content/en/tutorials-examples/tutorials) repository, where they appear as part of the documentation site.

## Getting Started

To contribute a new tutorial, follow the steps below:

### 1. Start from the template

Download the [tutorial Markdown template](https://github.com/Neurodesk/neurodesk.github.io/blob/main/.github/content-templates/tutorial-template.md) file from GitHub and edit it locally with your own content. 


The template includes:

- A frontmatter block with `title`, `linkTitle`, `description`, and other metadata
- A placeholder author attribution block
- Section headings and content structure for a clear tutorial layout

### 2. Follow best practices

- Use clear, descriptive section headers
- Include step-by-step instructions with commands and screenshots
- Store images in the appropriate `/static/` folder and link them with full paths
- Write in plain Markdown, using Hugo formatting where needed

See existing [tutorial examples](/tutorials-examples/tutorials/) for reference.
