  A brief guide for contributing new example notebooks.
---

We welcome example notebooks that demonstrate how to use tools within Neurodesk. These notebooks serve as valuable learning resources and promote reproducible workflows across the neuroimaging community.

Example notebooks are hosted in the [`neurodesk/example-notebooks`](https://github.com/Neurodesk/example-notebooks) repository and are intended to be lightweight, self-contained, and easy to follow.

---

## Getting Started

To contribute a new notebook, follow the steps below:

### 1. Start from the template

Use the official [example notebook template](https://github.com/Neurodesk/example-notebooks/blob/main/template.ipynb) as a starting point. It includes guidance on formatting, structure, metadata, and citation instructions.

Each notebook should contain:

- A clear title and short description - aim for a short title that will fit in the left menu
- An overview of the tool or workflow demonstrated 
- The container/tool version used
- Code cells with explanatory comments
- Example data (or guidance on how to access it)

{{< alert title="Python packages" >}}
please consult the python packages included in the base image [see list here](https://github.com/neurodesk/neurodesktop/blob/main/Dockerfile). If you are using python packages different than these, be sure to `pip install` them in the workflow
{{< /alert >}}

### 2. Follow best practices

- Keep notebooks self-contained and executable top to bottom. Before being published, a Github Action will confirm the Notebook is working.
- Avoid hardcoded file paths where possible
- Use publicly accessible datasets
- Include inline comments and Markdown cells for explanation

For more detail, consult the [README in the example-notebooks repository](https://github.com/Neurodesk/example-notebooks#readme).
