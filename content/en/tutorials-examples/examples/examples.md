[Install Neurodesk](https://www.neurodesk.org/docs/getting-started) and load these example notebooks

OR 

[Each Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/NeuroDesk/example-notebooks) in the repository is equipped with two buttons at the top: a Binder button and a Google Colab button. These buttons will allow you to interact with the notebooks in a cloud-based environment. The environment is pre-configured to support Neurodesk, so you can start experimenting with the notebooks right away without having to install any additional software or packages.
